# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

V.Isualize, the CEO of PyBer, has requested an analysis of company performance based on city type. This analysis will consist of:

- City type level summary
- Graph comparing city type fare summary for the first four months of 2019

The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights and recommendations into PyBer's ride sharing performance to allow for the company to make informed strategic decisions.

## Results

The below chart summarizes the results of the analysis across various key metrics

- Total Drivers
  - For Total Drivers for Urban (2405) is 4.9x greater than Suburban (490) and 30.8x greater than Rural (78)

- Total Fares
  - For Total Fares for Urban ($39,854.38) is 2.1x greater than Suburban ($19,356.33) and 9.2x greater than Rural ($4,327.93)

- Average Fare per Ride
  - For Average Fare per Ride for Rural ($34.62) is 1.1x greater than Suburban ($30.97) and 1.4x greater than Urban ($24.53)

The below graph summarizes the comparative weekly fare performance for each city type during the first four months of 2019.

From this it can be observed that for all weeks shown, Urban cities had the highest fare revenue, while Rural cities had the lowest.  The lines are relatively flat for each city type, no more than $1,000 difference between the highest and the lowest weeks for each line, indicating that demand is overall fairly consistent during the time period observed. The busiest time was the third week of February when all three city times saw a spike in users.

## Summary

In summary there are three recommendations for the company to consider. 

1. Urban cities are overserved when it comes to drivers. There are far more drivers (2,405) then there were rides (1,625) and it is impacting the average fare per driver. Incentives should be offered to Urban drivers to cover Suburban or Rural territory. This will have the effect of growing ridership and improving service in those areas while increasing the average fare per driver for the remaining Urban drivers.

2. Rural and Suburban cities, while much having lower total fares, had much higher average fares per ride. This means that even a small increase in ridership in these areas will have a significant impact on the revenue generated. Therefore, marketing efforts should be focused on these areas to get the most impact. 

3. Finally, there was a spike in ridership for all city types in the third week of February. This indicates that this is probably a period of high travel for residents of all the cities of the company's coverage area. This would be an opportune time to target marketing and promotions aimed at attracting new users to the PyBer service.
