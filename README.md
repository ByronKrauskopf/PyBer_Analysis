From this it can be observed that for all weeks shown Urban cities had the highest fare revenue while Rural cities had the lowest.  The lines are relatively flat for each city type, no more than $1000 difference between the highest and the lowest weeks for each line, indicating that demand is overall fairly consistent during the time period observed. The busest time was the thrid week of February when all three city times saw a spike in users.
